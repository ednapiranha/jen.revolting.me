      <h1>Interfaces of the Future</h1>
      <p>Imagine a world five or ten years from now, where the idea of doing software development goes beyond creating a webpage. Or the idea of mobile apps that allow you to text messages, emoji, photos and videos go beyond those actions to interact with others online.</p>

      <p>Initially this might sound like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life">Second Life</a> but I want us to think further than merely manipulating virtual three dimensional objects with two dimensional views. If we used virtual reality to change three dimensional (or possibly even four dimensional) space with our real environment, we could create multiple possibilities for how we work in software development and how we interact in future social networks.</p>
      <h2>Developing Software</h2>
      <p>For software development, we currently type into a two dimensional space to create our n-dimensional output. For two dimensions, it is easy to use an X and Y grid to map out everything. When a third dimension is added, it becomes less intuitive to imagine where Z is and the process to operate in that world is awkward and unnatural. Instead, if we used our environment and interacted with our physical space to control where X, Y and Z are, then we would have an easier time moving everything in the right position and not have to concern ourselves with the number precision, since moving the points in physical space will record the exact value.</p>
      <p>To take this even further, think about a massive multi-developer virtual space that enables multiple developers to work on the same software in realtime and in three dimensions. How would we design such a system? How would it change developer ergonomics and general design and usability decisions?</p>
      <h2>Communicating Online</h2>
      <p>Currently when we socialize with others online, we send text messages, emoji, videos and photos. All of our existing iterations involve slightly different ways of presenting our limited media, such as filters, sizes and colors to name a few.</p>
      <p>If we take this into a three dimensional environment and interface with n-dimensional interactions, you could send someone a physical movement as communication but send the movement to multiple recipients at the same time. Body movement, virtual environment setting and mood can all change the communication to go beyond our standard tools. We wouldn't need keyboards or cameras for every situation - or at all.</p>
      <h2>Combining Two Worlds?</h2>
      <p>We could take it even further and see if combining software development and online communications can create a new kind of IDE. It might seem silly at first to have people move around to make software, but we already have treadmills and standing desks for people to <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25222820">avoid sitting too much</a> for long periods of time.</p>
