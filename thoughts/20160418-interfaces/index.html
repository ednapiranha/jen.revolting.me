      <h1>The Future of Interfaces and Software</h1>
      <h2>Interfaces That Go Beyond Webpages: The Disclaimer</h2>
      <p>Recently, I've been looking at what the future of online communications will look like based on the trends from the past twenty years. Of course the disclaimer should be noted here - this is not what I think will happen, but something I think is a possibility.</p>
      <h2>Mobile and Tablets</h2>
      <p>The time we spend on phones and/or tablets has increased significantly and most of our interactions are through native applications or through webpages that adjusted their construction to work in responsive situations. In the end, everything seems to move closer to looking as similar as possible in order to provide the most familiar experience to end users.</p>
      <h2>The Conversation With Native and Web</h2>
      <p>We've gone through multiple iterations of creating frameworks and wrappers around existing systems to ease the process and most of the iterations so far have been awkward and feel unnatural. Developer usability is still limited in a wall of complexity that is unavoidable while we have external limitations that keep us from going beyond.</p>
      <p>When I first saw React Native, I was less interested in the React or Flux part of it - how one organizes a structure for a project is irrelevant in the long run. What interests me more is the portion that integrates the web-friendly portion to the native Objective-C and Java parts. How a wrapper is created to enable developer usability to extend from an existing knowledge base that most people are familiar with. Understanding how to standardize this binding piece makes the rest - in theory - easier to construct.</p>
      <h2>Interfaces of the Future</h2>
      <p>Imagine a world five or ten years from now, where the idea of webpages in their current state don't exist anymore. Imagine a situation where we interact with various interfaces (in which one could be native) through some system that enables us to change code or environmental constructions.</p>
      <p>For coding, we could do this through virtual reality to manipulate three-dimensional space and avoid doing guesswork through a two-dimensional system (like we currently do). Or a system that allows us to change code which updates the native interfaces immediately, without having to run multiple proprietary IDEs.</p>
      <p>For interaction, we could manipulate the interface in realtime as a way of communicating with other users in the environment. Instead of just writing texts or sending videos to each other to socialize, what if we moved and adjusted virtual space (post-emoji) as another layer of social networking?</p>
